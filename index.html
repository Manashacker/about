      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>My name is Manas Kumar. I am 11 years old. I have learned many languages such as HTML, CSS, JAVA Script, PHP and Python</p>
      <h3 id="font">How I started web development</h3>
      <p>It was time of December In year 2021 when all the schools are opened, One day, my one friend challenged me to make a website like him before this challenge I has no interest in coding i only edit pictures videos etc. But when he challenged me I don't know what I thinked at that time and started coding. I writed my first program in python in Pycharm code editor. The first code give so much courage that I started learning Flask and when I tried to make website by using Flask, sqlite, Flask SQLalchemy and HTML. It was a vey big faliure becuse without learning HTML I tried to make a website of HTML. So after this I started learning Html. I learned complete HTML in three weeks after tha I decided to learn css. But in CSS there are too many things that I learned but i was not able to master it after CSS I don't want to learn Javascript but it was essential because without Javascript a website is like a car without engine. So i learned it also but i hated Javascript beacuse i thought that python is the best language. So again i tried to make website using Flask but again this time i failed to make it. In this interval of time I also develop some interest in DJANGO but i didn't learn it because there was no clear information about it in MDN Refrence and I use to learn coding from MDN Refrence. If you didn't know what is MDN Refrence so let me tell you that it is a kind of website where code and information of a particular language is written.
      So after that I make many things in Python such as Artificial Intelligence, a flappy bird game ,a calculator and many other things. But know I have learned so many things in thoose six months that if any body will again challenge me in programming I will try to defeat him. You were thinking that what about my that friend who challenged me to make a website like him does I able to defeat him or i loose ? The answer is i defeated him very easil but he doesn't realises his defeat and continue his world full of over confidence and ego.
